# Entitlements

An entitlement represents a level of access, features, or content that a user is "entitled" to.

Entitlements are used to ensure a user has appropriate access to content based on their purchases, without having to manage all of the product identifiers in your app code.

Most apps only have one entitlement, unlocking all premium features. However, if you had two tiers of content such as Gold and Platinum, you would have 2 entitlements.

**A user's entitlements are shared across all apps contained within the same project.**
